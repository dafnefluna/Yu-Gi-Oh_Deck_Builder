At the moment we are looking to expand the functionality of the app for version 2. Some opportunities for contributation are to assisnt in creating a more complex deck editing function to remove cards, add cards from the deck page, drag cards to rearrange them in the UI. Expanding the User Page to create your own profile and upload profile pictures. Ideally we would love to have a settings page that where a user has more control on updating their user profile, updating their email, password, and profile.
